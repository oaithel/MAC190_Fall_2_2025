/*
A variable is a memory location associated with an identifier/name.
Variables have to be declared before used. To define a variable we use
type variableName = initialValue;
type is either a primitive type or a class. Primitive types: int, boolean, char, float,
double, short, long, ...
types that are classes: String, Double, Integer, Character, Float, BigDecimal, ...
variable names must not: start with a digit, contain a special character (space is one of them)
be one of the reserved words: public, private, class, static, void, main, if, else
while, do, import, ...
Do the following:


 */
public class Variables {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //define a variable to contain the number of students in the class
        //there are 20. Display it
        //define a variable to contain the change in your pockect
        //you have $14 and 57 cents. Display it
        //define a variable to contain your name, give your name. Display it
        //define a variable to contain a response of y for yes and n for no, the
        //answer is no. display it
        //define a variable to contain the dollar amount in your pocket, find it
        //from change in your pocket find it and display it
        //define a variable to contain the number of cents in your pocket. find it
