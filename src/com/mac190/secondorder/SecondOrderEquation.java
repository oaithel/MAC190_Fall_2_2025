/*
Write a java program that solves a second order equation in the form
aX^2 + bX + C = 0. a, b, and c coefficients are the inputs to your program.
if a is 0, then we have a first order equation, two cases for b:
    if b is 0, then we have two cases for c
        if c is 0 then (0 = 0), which has infinite number of silutions
        if c is not 0, then no solution
    if b is not 0, then it's a first order equation with one solution -c/b.
if a is not 0, then we compute D the dicriminant as D = b^2 - 4ac
    We have three cases:
    D is 0, then there is one double solution -b/2a
    D is larger than 0,we have two distinct solutions -b +- squareroot of D /2a
    D is negative, then no real solutions.
