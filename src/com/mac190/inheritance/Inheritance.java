/*
Use inheritance whenever you can describe an object as being another
object extended/augmented by other features.
Example: A circle IS apoint and inaddition it has a radius, so we can use inheritance.
When using inheritance, the derived (the class that inherits) will inherit everyhing
from the base class, member variables and methods alike.
You still cannot directly access private members of the base class in the derived class
and you should use setters and getters. If you need to access members of the base
class from the derived class, then they should be declared protected not private.
To inherit from a class, we use the key word extends.
See ICircle as an example of a class inheriting from Point.
