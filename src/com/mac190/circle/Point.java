/*
Design and implement a class Point that has the following:
- Two double member variables, coordinates X and Y
- Setters/getters for each and setter for both (first for X, second forY)
- Constructors: default, one that takes in one param for both X and Y
and one constructor that accepts two parameter, first for X second for Y
- Copy constructor
- Override toString to return the point as a string in the form (x, y)
- Override equals to compare two Points
- Method double distance(Point p) returns the distance between this point and p
- method Point add(Point p) returns the midpoint between this and p
- implement the previous methods as static (both distance and add)
